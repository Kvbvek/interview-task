Interview task

Main goal of task was to implement SystemVerilog RTL model to approximate trigonomic function. 
I assumed 3 stage pipeline model based on code provided in quadra_top.sv and quadra_tb.sv. The main obstacle for me was to convert number correctly from the internal value of sum, which had 4 integer bits to output y with 2 integer bits.
